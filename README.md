# Creative Programming Assignment 1

### Your next programming assignment will be a solo project and for this one you need to find your own dataset with at least `1000 rows` and at least `5 columns` of data *(at least one is numeric)*. 
1. You will submit a Jupyter notebook via github which reads the data, cleans it, and uses Python to answer a few interesting questions, at least one of which involves a plot. 
2. The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that you can load in an interesting dataset and use python and matplotlib to answer interesting questions about the data. This is a key skill in any Data Science or Machine Learning application.
